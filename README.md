 Block-Store
### <Block-Store> - Hack36 2K20(Team: CodeBreakers)
* Creating a <b>Dapp</b> based on Blockchain technologies like <b>Ethereum</b> and <b>IPFS</b>(InterPlanatary File System).

### Theme --> Smart Education

### -->Features<--

### Generic ::
* Automatic login system through metamask account address.
* User can upload file of any size(no restriction of 15 Gb like google drive).
* Cost of uploading file does not depends on the size of file rather it depends on the number of files.
* Users can search and view other users profile.

### Team Collaborator/Project Manager ::
* Utilize the power of IPFS to share important files among your team members through a fully decentralized system.
* Files shared through IPFS are encrypted via <b>Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)</b> to provide total control as to who can access them.
* Files in a project are managed in an efficient and well defined folder structure.    
* User can start a new project and send request to other users to join so as to work in a decentralized collaborative workspace.
* Any member of the project can access any file or folder of the project and can further share or delete it
* Members can also chat and post their queries regarding the project.

### Global and Peer-to-Peer(Encrypted) File Sharing App ::
* Files shared between two users are easily accessible due to Blockchain technology and protected through <b>Public</b> and <b>Private</b> Keys of the users using <b>RSA</b> encryption.
* IPFS allows for distributed storage of data that is <b>immune to altering and forgery</b>. Data stored on the IPFS network cannot be altered without changing the data identifier.
* IPFS leads to <b>improved user experience</b> in multiple cases. Content is delivered from the closest peers that possess a copy of the content removing the single-node pressure and improving the user experience.


### -->Advantages in smart education 
* Files ; like video tutorials, PDFs ; shared globally can be accessed by anyone without any third party restriction.
* Friends can make groups for studying together and posting Q&A.

### Advantages of Decentralized Cloud and Blockchain ::
* Transparency
* Security
* Efficiency
* Traceability


### Comparison between currently used File Sharing Applications(eg. Google Drive & Dropbox) &  ::
* Restrictive nature of some services as well as the more commonly understood reports of recent company <b>data leaks</b>.
* They are <b>centralised</b> systems and data shared and stored in them can easily be censored.
* We are using ipfs for file storing and sharing purpose which is based on <b>content addressing</b>. In case of files here , no copy of file created instead only a encrypted hash is provided to the receipent through which he can access the file.
* IPFS being content addressed it helps in <b>lowering the bandwidth consumption</b> and faster file access.
* User can upload their personal files that are only accessible to them (eg. certificates , important documents).
* Using of decentralized system to store files provides the user more security as our files are at great risk if they are in the hands of a single individual (they can access our personal data and can sell it).
* Global space where anyone can post any type of file ( pdf,video,image,txt) to share with other users.
* Users can also <b>request for a particular content</b> file in the global space by posting a request
